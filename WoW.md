**Sprint Backlog**

We use DoR (Definition of Ready) to inform an item is ready for development, so it enters the Sprint backlog.

We use DoD (Definition of Done) to validate the work on the item is complete, so it leaves the Sprint backlog.

The Sprint backlog is defined in the Sprint planning meeting.

**DoR (Definition of Ready)**

The work item …

is represented by a User Story

is covered by acceptance criteria

is mapped to an interface (when necessary)

dependencies are identified (if any)

**DoD (Definition of Done)**

The work item …

delivers an increment of the product

complies with the established acceptance criteria

is documented for use

adheres to the coding and technical standards

maintains product performance indices
